# index.html
<p> In this file we will work on the basic template of the daily planner. 
I added rows and columns along with save buttons inside of the container that was provided to us. 
This helped me create 9 time slots for a 9-5 day. </p>
<p>We added rows , columns and buttons inside those containers to make things more accessible for us

# style.css
<p> In this file we will figure out a way to make the daily planner look appealing by adding specific style elements to each row, time-block, button, etc. 
We started by tweaking the style.css file by changing the shape and radius of the rows and buttons and also by changing the color scheme! </p>

# script.js
<p>In this file we implement a way to get real world time into our header using the moment.js libraray. </p>
<p> We also use local storage to store data in it and persist even when the page reloads. </p>
<p> Lastly we will dynamically color code the hour block based on the real world time. </p>

# Facilities used! 
<p> Moment.js </p>
<p> Bootstrap </p>
<p> Font Awesome </p>
<p> Google Fonts </p>
